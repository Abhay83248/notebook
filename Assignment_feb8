Sol1:-
        Abstraction is feature of object oriented programming language.It is used to hide information and variables of a  
        class from outside world by making it private.it is used to make methods prototype only.
 
       Example:- class class1:
                            def shape():
                                 pass  
                       class class2(class1):
                             def rectangle(self,length,breadth):
                                  print(“Area of rectangle is :”,length*breadth)
                       class class3(class1):
                             def triangle(self,length,height):
                                print(“Area of triangle is :”,½(*length*height))
                      obj1=class2(2,3)
                         obj1.rectangle()
                     obj2=class3(2,3)
                        obj2.triangle()
                         
                            OUTPUT:-
                                              Area of rectangle is 6
                                             Area of triangle is 3

                       
Sol 2:-Both Abstraction and Encaptulation is is used to hide variables and methods from outer the class.
          But the only difference is that user can set and set data in Encaptulated class by change or set data method 
         Which is publicly defined by that Encaptulated class.
Sol 3:-
          The ‘abc’ module in python is provides infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.
Sol4:-Data abstraction is achieved by importing abc module and declaring class and method as abstraction class and 
         Abstract method by the keyword abstract.
Sol 5:-We can create instance of a an abstract class as follows
           Object name=classname()
